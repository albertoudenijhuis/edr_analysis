Typical usage
=============
import edrlib
velocity_series                 = {}        #dictionary containing everything
velocity_series['domain']       = 'space'   #either 'space' or 'time'
velocity_series['dx']           = 0.1       #units: m
velocity_series['y']            = v         #place here the velocity series, units: m/s

edrlib.kolmogorov_constants(velocity_series, 'full')           #set Kolmogorov constants 
edrlib.do_edr_retrievals(velocity_series)           #do edr retrievals with different methods
edrlib.printstats(velocity_series)                  #print retrieved edr values
edrlib.makeplots(velocity_series)                   #make plots of it all

#for the time domain, update two lines to:
#velocity_series['domain']      = 'time'
#velocity_series['dt']          = 0.1       #units: s

Testing
=======
For testing the class can be executed from the command line:
./edrlib.py
Three test will be run. See the function test() at the bottom of this file for the details.
